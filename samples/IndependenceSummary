independent dominions of India and Pakistan (including what is now Bangladesh) with effect from 15 August 1947, and granted complete
legislative authority upon the respective constituent assemblies of the new countries.[19] The Act received royal assent on 18 July 1947.


									SUMMARY 

 Immediate background
In 1946, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, realised that it had neither the mandate at home, the international support nor the reliability of native forces for continuing to maintain control in an increasingly restless India.

The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of India and Pakistan (including what is now Bangladesh) with effect from 15 August 1947, and granted complete legislative authority upon the respective constituent assemblies of the new countries.
